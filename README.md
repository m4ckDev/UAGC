## 📌 Purpose

This repository contains coursework, labs, and personal extensions developed throughout my UAGC cybersecurity program.  
The goal is not only to complete assignments, but to **build real-world security, automation, and system administration skills** that translate directly into operational environments.

Projects emphasize:

• Windows security monitoring  
• PowerShell automation  
• Python-based security scripting  
• Log analysis and detection logic  
• Secure configuration templating  
• Documentation and reproducibility

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

This portfolio reflects my approach to cybersecurity development:

• learn concepts deeply, not superficially  
• build tools instead of only reading about them  
• document everything for reproducibility  
• simulate real-world security workflows  
• continuously refine scripts beyond assignment requirements  

---

## 📈 Future Expansion

This repository will continue to grow with:

- advanced detection engineering  
- threat hunting automation  
- SIEM-style log correlation projects  
- defensive scripting improvements  
- offensive security lab integrations  

---

## 🤝 Academic Integrity

All work represents my own implementation of course objectives, with additional experimentation performed to reinforce learning and practical skill development.
